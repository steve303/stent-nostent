# stent-nostent

Three machine learning classifiers were used to predict stent/no stent label.  Each notebook is dedicated to a classifier's analysis.

The classifiers were: 
1) Neural Network - 3 layer fully connected
2) Adaboost decision tree
3) SVM with PCA preprocessing

Lastly, one notebook is dedicated to EDA - exploratory data analysis.
